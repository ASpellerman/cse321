How to use the things in this repo in conjunction with the project:
The code in the finalCode/finalCode.ino file is good to go. Upload that to the arduino and it will work, 
provided that the angles in the code match the angles that the sensors are laid out in.
If the angles are different, you can measure them out with a protractor and change them in that file, 
or you could run the unity game and make the circles match the sensors, then press the send 
button. That will generate a folder that has the code in it with those new angles. To run the game, 
extract game.zip into a folder called "game". Run the file named "My Project" and it will work. 
The game can be accessed by running game/My project. It will generate the code into the 
Test/Test.ino file. Additionally, the motortest file just rotates the motor to 180 degrees and 90 degrees, 
switching every two seconds.

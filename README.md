How to use the things in this repo in conjunction with the project:
The code in the final.ino file is good to go. Upload that to the arduino and it will work, 
provided that the angles in the code match the angles that the sensors are laid out in.
If the angles are different, you can measure them out with a protractor and change them, 
or you could run the unity game and make the circles match the sensors, then press the send 
button. That will generate a folder that has the code in it with those new angles.
